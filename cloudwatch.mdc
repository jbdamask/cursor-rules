You have access to AWS Log Analyzer MCP. This allows you to search AWS CloudWatch logs for this project. 

If the user asks for help searching for information in the logs, you need to know the date and time so your search results are relevant. Before invoking the MCP, run `date` in your shell so that you know the date and time.
